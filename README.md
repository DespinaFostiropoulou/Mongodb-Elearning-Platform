# MongoDB e-Learning Course  
### Educational Database Design & Teaching Material

This repository contains the implementation and educational material developed for my Master's Thesis:

**"Development of a MongoDB Database and Supporting Educational Material"**

The project focuses on teaching MongoDB and NoSQL concepts through an interactive e-learning approach using the Open eClass platform.
